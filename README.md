# VLSI Interview Ace

This is a Next.js application that provides a platform for VLSI students to take mock interviews using a voice-based AI for different job roles.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

The main application flow starts at `/dashboard`. You can select a job role to start a mock interview, and after completion, you will be redirected to a performance report.
